# JavaScript code comment labeling tool

This was the tool i developed for Natural Language Processing class during my Master studies to speed up labeling dataset for final project.

This tool was **NOT** official requirement of the project, it was rather product of me being lazy and procrastinating, rather than actually preparing dataset for ML pipeline :D
Nevertheless, it helped me to finish labeling my dataset sooner (even though it took a few days to develop it), than if i was manually fiddling with CSV files.
